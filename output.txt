"What happened here?",
"Thank God you are there. Please help me! I am hurt, there are nails stuck in my flipper.  ",
"Oh, no! You seem really hurt! Let me take a look…",
"[some sound I guess]",
"Careful, please. These spikes had me impaled for some time. ",
"Who did this to you? It is awful! ",
"Don’t worry about that, little girl. You keep this plank. I managed to float here on it since I couldn’t swim because of my injured flipper.. ",
"W...Wh..Why?",
"Take it with you, it could be useful, sometime. Take the nails just in case, too…",
