What happened here?
Thank God you are there. Please help me! I am hurt, there are nails stuck in my flipper.  
Oh, no! You seem really hurt! Let me take a look…
[some sound I guess]
Careful, please. These spikes had me impaled for some time. 
Who did this to you? It is awful! 
Don’t worry about that, little girl. You keep this plank. I managed to float here on it since I couldn’t swim because of my injured flipper.. 
W...Wh..Why?
Take it with you, it could be useful, sometime. Take the nails just in case, too…
